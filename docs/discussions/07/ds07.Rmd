## Discuss together (≤ 5 min)

As an entire section, discuss these together:

1. Are your estimates of the parameters of a model random or fixed? Why?
2. What does it mean to find a confidence interval for an estimate? Explain in the context of conducting the same experiment many times.

<br/>




## Exercise

Today's exercise is intended to be a gentle introduction/review of estimation. We will be using _**real data**_ from the [US Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes) to build a model to **estimate the frequency of earthquakes** across the world.

As usual, break off into **groups of 3-4 students**. In your group, nominate one person to share their screen.




### Background

In seismology (the study of earthquakes), the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes (in a certain place and period of time) can be modeled by the [Gutenberg-Richter law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) (GR law). Let $M$ be the [Richter magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) of a seismic event, and $N$ be the number of events with magnitude _**greater than or equal to $M$**_. Then, the GR law states that $$N=10^{a-bM}$$ or in other words $$\log_{10}(N)=a-bM$$ where $a$ and $b$ are unknown constants. Note that this relationship should appear as a line on a plot of $\log_{10}(N)$ vs $M$.

<br/>




### Data import

This dataset contains every earthquake (on the planet, not just in the US) of magnitude 4.5 or greater that was detected by USGS from beginning of 2017 to end of 2020. A description of each of the columns can be [found here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php).

For convenience, much of the data cleaning and preprocessing has already been done for you; [**download the prepared data here**](quakes.us.csv.gz) and **save into the same directory as this source file**. Then, uncomment and run the lines of code below to import the data.

```{r}
# library(tidyverse)
# 
# parseTime = function(times){
#   return(as.POSIXct(strptime(times,"%Y-%m-w%d %H:%M:%OS",tz="UTC")))
# }
# 
# quakes = read.csv("quakes.csv.gz") %>%
#   mutate_at(c("time","updated"),parseTime)


# EXPLANATION:
# parseTime is a function used to convert datetime strings to datetime format
# mutate_at is used to apply parseTime to both the "time" and "updated" columns
# the main columns we need are time and mag.binned (magnitude rounded to nearest half integer)
```

For our purposes, this data needs to be summarized to obtain $N$ for each year, i.e. the number of earthquakes with magnitude at least as strong as a given value of $M$. Since this is a bit tricky, it's also been done for you below.

```{r}
# quakes.count = quakes %>%
#   count(year,mag.binned,name='count') %>%
#   group_by(year) %>%
#   mutate(N = rev(cumsum(rev(count))), year=as.factor(year))


# EXPLANATION:
# count(year,mag.binned) counts how many events with that magnitude occurred each year
#   (see https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html for more info)
# 
# group_by(year) followed by cumsum(...) takes the cumulative sum in each year
# the rev(...rev(...)) runs this cumsum in reverse (otherwise we get ≤M instead of ≥M)
# 
# we also change year to factor for use in ggplot later
#   (aesthetics like group, color, shape, etc. often need a factor to work properly)
```

Before moving onto the next step, inspect the data frame to **make sure you completely understand what it represents** and check that everything looks right. (Your first and last rows should look something like `2017, 4.5, 6847, 9472` and `2020, 7.0, 10, 10`).

```{r}
# head(quakes.count,10)
```

<br/>




### Visualization

As usual, the **first step is to visualize the data**. Make a **scatter plot** of $\log_{10}(N)$ vs $M$ (note this means $M$ is on the horizontal axis (you say $y$ vs $x$, NOT $x$ vs $y$)). Then, **add a line plot on top**, making sure the **years are correctly grouped** together and distinguished from each other (use something like `color` or `shape` or even `linetype`, or a combination of them, use your judgment to determine what looks best).

_Note: you can either use either use `log10(N)` as the `x` aesthetic, OR directly use `x=N` and just rescale the axis to be logarithmic. I recommend this second method since it makes the axis easier to read ([see here for an example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9223257))._

Ideally, it might look something like this:

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlrohe/340-Spring21/master/docs/discussions/07/plot.png" style="width:240px;"></center>

```{r}
# ggplot(quakes.count,aes(...)) + ...
```

<br/>




### Estimation

Next, we will fit a simple linear regression to the data to estimate $a$ and $b$. Complete the line of code below to fit the model (don't forget the linear relationship is NOT between $N$ and $M$ but rather between $\log_{10}(N)$ and $M$).

```{r}
# lm.quakes = lm(...)
```

View a summary of the model to see coefficients' estimates, $p$-values, and other relevant info.

```{r}
# summary(lm.quakes)
```

From your fit, what are your estimates for the constants $a$ and $b$? Pay **careful attention** to the signs here! (hint: remember the GR law uses the convention $a-bM$ whereas R assumes you are fitting `intercept + slope * M`, so therefore `slope` = $-b$).

Try to avoid copy-pasting or manually typing in values. The `coef()` function lets you extract coefficients from a model object (e.g. `lm.quakes`). You can then use `[i]` to access the i-th value of this coefficients vector. You may also want to use `unname()` at the end to remove the name from the value (if you don't, it may carry through later calculations and no longer be a correct name for the output value).

```{r}
# a = ...?
# b = ...?
```

(Hint: if you did this correctly, `a+b` should be about `10.49`)

<br/>




### Checking fit

It's always nice to visually check your fit to make sure everything looks right. Plot your line of best fit alone with the data points below.

This time, I recommend using `log10(N)` as the `x` aesthetic, then using [`geom_abline()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html) to plot your line of regression using your estimated slope and intercept values (this avoids dealing with distorted axis cause by the other method). Note you can use your variables `a` and `b` here that were defined previously to avoid manually typing in numerical estimates (which is almost always bad!).

```{r}
# ggplot(quakes.count,aes(...)) + ...
```

You can also check the residuals of your fit. This is fairly convenient to do in base R. Note there is **slight heteroscedasticity** due to the fact that higher magnitude earthquakes occur much less often than lower magnitude earthquakes so it's harder to estimate them as precisely. **This is expected** and not a huge threat to the validity of our model.

```{r}
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# plot(lm.quakes,which=1:2)
```

<br/>




### Confidence

Give $99\%$ confidence intervals for $a$ and $b$ ([help page](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/confint)).

```{r}
# confint(...)
```

Give a brief interpretation of these intervals.

### Predictions

From the [GR law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law#Background), we can deduce that the total number of earthquakes of **any magnitude** must be $N_\text{Total}=10^a$. Using your estimate for $a$, _**approximately**_ how many earthquakes are there in total every year on Earth? (Remember to think about how precisely you can estimate this and **round your answer appropriately!** Not all the digits you get from R are significant, so you only need some of them!).

Use the box below to compute your answer, then respond with a short sentence below.

```{r}
# perform calculations here
```

> _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_



Using your $99\%$ confidence interval for $a$, give an approximate $99\%$ confidence interval for $N_\text{Total}$.

```{r}
# perform calculations here
```

> _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_



According to your model, how many earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater do you expect to see on average every year?

```{r}
# perform calculations here
```

> _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_



According to your model, you would expect to see an earthquake with magnitude between 9 and 9.5 on average every how many years?

```{r}
# perform calculations here
```
