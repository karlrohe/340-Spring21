## Just for fun (1 min)

<center><a href="https://xkcd.com/539/"><img id="comic" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png" title="... okay, but because you said that, we're breaking up." style="width:555px;"></a></center>

<br/>



## Discuss together (10-15 min)

As an entire section, discuss these together:

1. How do you interpret an interaction term? (For example, if TV and radio advertising spending were found to have a significant interaction term with estimate 0.0011 when predicting sales, what does the 0.0011 physically mean?) Can you give 2 different interpretations?

2. Remember adding _**any**_ term to your `lm( )` formula will _**always**_ decrease the RSS, even if it's useless (like Karl said, you can test this by adding a randomly-generated column to any regression). How then do you test if adding an effect is significant?

3. How do you include a higher order term in a regression, and what does it represent? (For example, if TV advertising was found to have a significant quadratic term with estimate -0.002, what does it physically mean?)

4. What is the [hierarchy principle](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/03-linear_regression.pdf#page=56), what does it mean, and why should we follow it?

<br/>



## Brief reading (optional, ~ 5 min)

Remember interaction can exist between any combination (2 or more) of categorical and quantitative variables. If you feel like you have a good understanding of how to interpret each of these cases, feel free to move on the next section; if you don't, briefly reading [this page](https://biologyforfun.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/interpreting-interaction-coefficient-in-r-part1-lm/) is highly recommended (pay close attention to the difference in wording for each interpretation and how that difference is reflected in the plots).

<br/>



## Exercise

For the exercise, I have _**modified mtcars**_ by reducing it to the first four columns (`mpg` is still the dependent variable; your predictor variables are now `cyl` `disp` and `hp`), and adding in some combination of significant interactions and/or quadratic terms.

Run the code below to import the new modified data frame, then fit a complete model with **ALL interaction and quadratic** terms (it is not uncommon to add all interaction terms, but you usually wouldn't add all quadratic terms like this unless you had a good reason; we're just doing it here for the sake of the exercise).

```{r}
mtcars2 = as_tibble(read.csv(     # first use base R read.csv, then convert to tibblex
  row.names = 1,                  # row.names=1 means treat first column as row names
  text = ",mpg,cyl,disp,hp        # text='....' means use this string of text as the data

After importing the new mtcars data, repeat **all interpretation and prediction steps** of [discussion 9](https://karlrohe.github.io/340-Spring21/discussions/09/ds09.html). Specifically, answer the following questions:


1. What are the coefficient estimates and standard errors? Give an interpretation of **one of the new terms** added in this discussion.

   > _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_

2. What are the R² and adjusted R² for this model? Give an interpretation of both.

   > _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_

3. Give $95\%$ confidence intervals for all coefficients. Give an interpretation of **one of the new intervals**.

   > _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_

4. According to the model, what mileage would I expect on average with a car that has 6 cylinders, 200 displacement, and 120 horsepower? Be careful in your calculation with the interactions and quadratic terms.

   > _**REPLACE TEXT WITH RESPONSE**_
